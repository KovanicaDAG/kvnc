//! Multi-node (4-validator) in-process consensus integration test.
//!
//! Drives four independent consensus engines entirely in-process: no sockets,
//! no async runtime, no wall-clock timing. Blocks and votes are exchanged as
//! explicit [`Wire`] events through an in-memory delivery harness so every
//! schedule is fully deterministic and runs in well under a second.
//!
//! The consensus `common` helpers live in the sibling crate's test tree and are
//! included by path (a single source of truth for `MockDag`,
//! `MockBlockManager`, and the block/committee builders), exactly as the
//! single-node integration test does.
//!
//! # Partition model
//!
//! Full DAG networking is out of scope for an in-process test, so partitions
//! are modelled at the *message delivery* layer instead of by faking TCP:
//!
//! * All four nodes first receive the complete canonical block DAG. This is the
//!   "blocks propagated before the partition" phase. Every node therefore holds
//!   an identical block set, so committed sub-DAG ancestry is always complete
//!   and the test never has to reason about missing-parent recovery.
//! * A partition then restricts *vote* delivery to within each side. A side
//!   whose total vote stake reaches the committee quorum threshold
//!   (`floor(2T/3) + 1`) commits; a side below it stalls.
//! * Healing re-delivers the withheld votes so the stalled side reaches quorum
//!   and commits the identical leader sequence.
//!
//! For a 4-authority committee with equal stake, `quorum_threshold = 3`. This
//! makes the partition arithmetic exact: 3 votes commit, 2 votes (or 1) do not.
