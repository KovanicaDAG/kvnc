//! Red (non-blue) mergeset blocks of a MysticGhost commit (#13, variant A).
//!
//! Red blocks are not executed as blocks (they are never part of
//! [`CommittedSubDag::blocks`]), but their transactions must not be lost:
//! the committed sub-DAG lists them in [`CommittedSubDag::non_blue`] and
//! [`non_blue_transactions`] returns their transactions so the node can hand
//! them back to the mempool. Red blocks stay in the DAG until ordinary round
//! pruning (`prune_waves_before`); `prune_non_blue` is no longer called.
//!
//! Both helpers are pure functions of the DAG contents, so the live commit
//! path and the node's recovery path produce identical results when they call
//! them over the same DAG.
