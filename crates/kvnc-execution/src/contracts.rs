//! Contract dispatch layer — the real execution path for the four contract
//! crates (`kvnc-htlc`, `kvnc-vault`, `kvnc-multisig`, `kvnc-token`).
//!
//! Two paths share one state model:
//!
//! - **Native dispatch** ([`execute_contract_call`]): bincode-decodes the
//!   fixed ABI argument tuple, calls the crate's typed API directly through a
//!   [`ContractHost`], bincode-encodes the Ok result. Byte-for-byte identical
//!   results to the wasm path (both encode the same values with the same
//!   `bincode` configuration).
//! - **Wasmi dispatch** ([`ContractRunner::execute_wasm_call`]): compiles the
//!   crate's `wasm32-unknown-unknown` cdylib artifact and runs the same entry
//!   name through [`kvnc_runtime::Runtime`], whose `env` imports are backed by
//!   the *same* [`ContractHost`].
//!
//! ## `ContractHost` semantics (FIXED — read before changing)
//!
//! A `ContractHost` is created per call and holds:
//!
//! - an immutable context: contract address, caller, block height, timestamp;
//! - **one redb read snapshot** ([`redb::ReadTransaction`]) covering the whole
//!   call, so repeated reads are repeatable even if another writer commits
//!   mid-call (redb is MVCC: read transactions may coexist with write
//!   transactions — verified against redb 2.6 source: `begin_read` documents
//!   "Read transactions may exist concurrently with writes", and
//!   `start_write_transaction` only waits for other *write* transactions);
//! - an **in-memory overlay**: pending storage writes, touched accounts, and
//!   emitted events.
//!
//! Reads consult the overlay first, then the snapshot. Storage writes are
//! **namespaced by contract address**: the table key is
//! `(contract_addr, blake3(raw_key))` — contracts pass their raw (variable
//! length) keys, the host derives the fixed 32-byte table key with
//! [`kvnc_common::hash`], so two contracts can use the same raw key without
//! collision.
//!
//! **Commit rules:**
//!
//! - [`ContractHost::commit`] is called *only* after the entry point returned
//!   `Ok`. It flushes the overlay into a single redb write transaction
//!   (snapshot dropped first) and returns the emitted events.
//! - **Single-writer mode** ([`ContractHost::new_in_txn`], used for every
//!   on-chain `Call`): reads go through the sub-DAG's open
//!   [`redb::WriteTransaction`] (so earlier writes such as the fee are
//!   visible) and `commit` applies the overlay into that same transaction —
//!   no second redb writer is ever opened. The apply is all-or-nothing via a
//!   pre-image journal. Standalone mode (`new`) keeps the snapshot + own
//!   write commit and must not be used while another writer is open.
//! - On a contract error (`ContractError`) the host is simply dropped:
//!   nothing — no storage write, no balance delta, no event — is committed.
//! - A failed backing read sets a *sticky* read error; `commit` then refuses
//!   to flush, so a transient storage failure can never silently corrupt a
//!   contract record (the call surfaces as [`ExecutionError::Other`]).
//!
//! Native balances are moved through the `ACCOUNTS` table
//! (`kvnc_storage::state_store::Account`); `amount > u64::MAX` maps to
//! `ContractError::Overflow`, a balance shortfall to `InsufficientBalance`.
//!
//! ## Spend authorization and host custody
//!
//! A contract may only spend (a) its **own** funds or (b) an amount the
//! signer **explicitly approved**. [`Host::transfer`] classifies `from`:
//!
//! 1. `from == contract` — own funds. Spendable is the contract account
//!    balance **minus the total held in custody**, so own spends can never
//!    touch escrowed funds. `to` is credited as a real account.
//! 2. `from == caller` while signed **attached value** (`Call.value`)
//!    remains — the value was already moved from the signer to the
//!    contract's real account before the entry point ran, so this pull only
//!    books up to the remaining attached value in the custody ledger under
//!    `to` (e.g. the HTLC/vault escrow address); no real balance moves again.
//!    `to` may not be the contract or the caller. Pulling more than the
//!    remaining attached value is `Unauthorized`.
//! 3. `from` has a custody balance in **this contract's** ledger — release:
//!    the ledger entry and the contract account are debited, `to` is credited
//!    as a real account.
//! 4. Anything else — `ContractError::Unauthorized`, nothing moved.
//!
//! **Attached value (`Call.value`, signature format v1).** Before the
//! entry point runs, [`ContractHost::attach_value`] moves the signed `value`
//! from the caller's real account to the contract's real account (rejected
//! with `InsufficientBalance` if the caller cannot cover it). Like every
//! host write it lives in the overlay, so a failed call moves nothing.
//! Value not booked into custody stays in the contract's own funds. The
//! former interim args-based create approval (decoding the `amount` of
//! `htlc_create`/`vault_create` arguments) is removed.
//!
//! **Custody ledger.** Custody balances are *virtual sub-accounts* stored in
//! the contract's own namespaced storage under the reserved raw-key prefix
//! [`RESERVED_HOST_PREFIX`] (`kvnc/host/`): `kvnc/host/custody/<addr32>`
//! (u64 LE) per sub-account and `kvnc/host/custody_total` (u64 LE). The
//! funds themselves sit in the contract's real account. Contracts cannot
//! read or write the reserved prefix: such an access marks the call as
//! failed (sticky error) and nothing is committed. Because the ledger is
//! per contract, one contract can never release another contract's custody,
//! and a user's real balance is never a custody balance.
//!
//! **Visibility:** escrow addresses (`htlc/escrow`, `vault/escrow`) hold a
//! *real* balance of 0; the escrowed amount is part of the contract
//! account's balance and is visible per escrow via the custody ledger.
//!
//! **Native dispatch** ([`execute_contract_call`]) rejects a contract address
//! without deployed code, and trusts its `caller` argument as the signer — it
//! must only be called with a signature-verified caller.
